      "comment" : "Most implementation guides target a single version - e.g. they describe how to use a particular version, and the profiles and examples etc are valid for that version. But some implementation guides describe how to use multiple different versions of FHIR to solve the same problem, or in concert with each other. Typically, the requirement to support multiple versions arises as implementation matures and different implementation communities are stuck at different versions by regulation or market dynamics.",
