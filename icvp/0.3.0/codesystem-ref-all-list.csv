It includes both active and inactive vaccines available in the US. CVX codes for inactive vaccines allow transmission of historical immunization records. When a MVX (manufacturer) code is paired with a CVX (vaccine administered) code, the specific trade named vaccine may be indicated. These codes should be used for immunization messages using either HL7 Version 2.3.1 or HL7 Version 2.5.1. CVX is the underlying Master Code System for V2 table 0292 (Vaccines Administered). The machine readable name for CVX in PHIN VADS is PH_VaccinesAdministeredCVX_CDC_NIP. The version of the CVX code set for certification can be found on the archive page:[https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp)     The Status column indicates if the vaccine is currently available in the United States.    *  Active: A currently available administrable vaccine     *  Inactive: An administrable vaccine formulation that is no longer available for patient administration, but can be found in historical patient records OR A historical record of a vaccine administered where the exact formulation is unknown     *  Pending: A vaccine that is expected to become active in the future     *  Non-US: A vaccine that available outside the US only     *  Never Active: A vaccine that was never available and is not in the pipeline of new vaccines     The Last Updated column indicates the last time this particular vaccine code was updated in this table.

Linearization is similar to the classical print versions of ICD Tabular List (e.g. volume I of ICD-10 or other previous editions). The main linearization of ICD-11 is Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS). Various linearizations could be built at different granularity, use case or other purposes such as for Primary Care, Clinical Care or Research. The linkage from the foundation component to a particular linearization will ensure consistent use of the ICD.""

LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/document-classcodes,ValueSet/doc-typecodes,ValueSet/doc-section-codes"
