      "description" : "The CDC's National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD - see [https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/)) developed and maintains the CVX (vaccine administered) code set. It includes both active and inactive vaccines available in the US. CVX codes for inactive vaccines allow transmission of historical immunization records. When a MVX (manufacturer) code is paired with a CVX (vaccine administered) code, the specific trade named vaccine may be indicated. These codes should be used for immunization messages using either HL7 Version 2.3.1 or HL7 Version 2.5.1. CVX is the underlying Master Code System for V2 table 0292 (Vaccines Administered). The machine readable name for CVX in PHIN VADS is PH_VaccinesAdministeredCVX_CDC_NIP. The version of the CVX code set for certification can be found on the archive page:[https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp) \r\n\r\nThe Status column indicates if the vaccine is currently available in the United States.\r\n\r\n*  Active: A currently available administrable vaccine \r\n\r\n*  Inactive: An administrable vaccine formulation that is no longer available for patient administration, but can be found in historical patient records OR A historical record of a vaccine administered where the exact formulation is unknown \r\n\r\n*  Pending: A vaccine that is expected to become active in the future \r\n\r\n*  Non-US: A vaccine that available outside the US only \r\n\r\n*  Never Active: A vaccine that was never available and is not in the pipeline of new vaccines \r\n\r\nThe Last Updated column indicates the last time this particular vaccine code was updated in this table.\r\n\r\nQuestions regarding this table should be directed to the IIS Technical Assistance Team via iisinfo@cdc.gov (or use mailing address via [https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx#addr](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx#addr)) \r\n\r\nHL7 Implementers should note that 'Status' IS NOT CONCEPT STATUS as all codes are ACTIVE in this code system.\r\n\r\nThe current code system is available via [https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx)",

      "description" : "\"The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, known more commonly as ICF, is a classification of health and health-related domains. As the functioning and disability of an individual occurs in a context, ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.\r\n\r\nICF is the WHO framework for measuring health and disability at both individual and population levels.\r\n\r\nICF was officially endorsed by all 191 WHO Member States in the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001(resolution [WHA 54.21](http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA54/ea54r21.pdf) ) as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability.\r\n\r\nICF is based on the same foundation as ICD and ICHI and share the same set of extension codes that enable documentation at a higher level of detail.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Dutch translation of the ICF is published in book form by BSL. The ICF can also be consulted online in the [Classification Browser](https://class.whofic.nl/browser.aspx?scheme=ICF-nl.cla).\r\n\r\nThe ICF team of the WHO-FIC Collaborating Center combines expertise in the field of the ICF for the Dutch language area and currently consists of delegations from the Netherlands Paramedical Institute, the University Medical Center Groningen, Maastricht University, the Big Move Institute, Stichting Scientific Research Road Safety, University of Ghent, Vilans, and Rehabilitation Center de Hoogstraat.\"\r\n\r\nOfficial updates to the ICF are available as annual lists of changes.\r\n\r\nThese updates are approved annually at the October meeting of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) Network.\r\n\r\nTo license ICF, the same rules apply for ICF as for ICD. See [http://icd.who.int/](http://icd.who.int/).\r\n\r\nFor more information, see [https://www.whofic.nl/familie-van-internationale-classificaties/referentie-classificaties/icf](https://www.whofic.nl/familie-van-internationale-classificaties/referentie-classificaties/icf).",

The personas identified in this code system are defined based on the WHO recommendation for [Classifying health workers](https://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/Health_workers_classification.pdf). This recommendation uses codes from the [International Standard Classification for Occupations](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/index.htm) but defines several additional categories of health workers. In addition, the codes in that recommendation are focused on health workers, so codes for patient and care partner personas need to be considered as well. Where a code from the ISCO exists, it is used. Where a WHO recommended health worker category is used, a code is constructed beginning with a W. Where a code is introduced by this implementation guide, it is constructed beginning with a C. Note that the content is incomplete, pending a computable representation of the WHO recommendations.",

LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.",

The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.\r\n\r\nConceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.\r\n\r\nAct.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code \"potassium\" together with and Act.classCode for \"laboratory observation\" to somehow mean \"potassium laboratory observation\" and then use the same Act.code for \"potassium\" together with Act.classCode for \"medication\" to mean \"substitution of potassium\". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.",
