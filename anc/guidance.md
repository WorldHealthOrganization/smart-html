# Ids and Identifiers

To support flexibility in client and server implementation, resources created by client applications SHALL include an identifier corresponding to the logical id of the resource. The identifier SHALL include a type element with a code from the [WHO Identifier Types](CodeSystem-who-identifier-types.html) that indicates whether the identifier is `client-assigned` or `server-assigned`.
