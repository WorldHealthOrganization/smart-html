As the functioning and disability of an individual occurs in a context, ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.    ICF is the WHO framework for measuring health and disability at both individual and population levels.    ICF was officially endorsed by all 191 WHO Member States in the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001(resolution [WHA 54.21](http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA54/ea54r21.pdf) ) as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability.

""The Dutch translation of the ICF is published in book form by BSL. The ICF can also be consulted online in the [Classification Browser](https://class.whofic.nl/browser.aspx?scheme=ICF-nl.cla).    The ICF team of the WHO-FIC Collaborating Center combines expertise in the field of the ICF for the Dutch language area and currently consists of delegations from the Netherlands Paramedical Institute, the University Medical Center Groningen, Maastricht University, the Big Move Institute, Stichting Scientific Research Road Safety, University of Ghent, Vilans, and Rehabilitation Center de Hoogstraat.""

This recommendation uses codes from the [International Standard Classification for Occupations](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/index.htm) but defines several additional categories of health workers. In addition, the codes in that recommendation are focused on health workers, so codes for patient and care partner personas need to be considered as well.

Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/care-team-category,ValueSet/observation-codes,ConceptMap/LOINC"
